# FinalProject_RandomSignalsCourse
Grade: 98.
This is the final project of the course Random Signals. 3rd year of degree - Computer Engineering.
The topics that I learned in this course are thrilling to me.
Overall, All the topics might connect, in any aspect, to Propability, Applied Mathematics or random signals gettes the most attension from me. 
This work done by me and a colleague from college.

The main topics of this project are:
1) implementations of processes like: AR Process, White noise (and Gaussian), Bernoulli process and many more.
2) Simulations and Graphs, in MATLAB, describe uniform distribution, PDF of sum of random variables, Standart Gaussian distribution and many more.
3) WSS (Wide Sense Stationary) random processes, WSS in common.
4) Auto correlation of WSS processes and his attributes, like Cyclic convolution.
5) MSE (Mean Squere Error) - optimize the error using special filter (convolution in descrete time)
6) MMSE - Minimal Mean Squere Error
7) Classification by using logistic regression - compute and plot the best threshold (ROC curve)
8) Implementation of Markov process with given 2 different start condition (each condition is a row vector with 2 elements - the propabilities to get '0' or '1').
9) Implementation of the known game Snakes and Ladders in MATLAB. The game runs 100k times. We wrote a function runs the game one time. The function returns the number of turns to victory, based on given board (see the file 'Snakes&Ladders_BoardGame.png' located in this folder). We plotted the PDF and CDF of the number of steps are required to win the game. We got some interesting results shown in these plots. check Q6 folder.
